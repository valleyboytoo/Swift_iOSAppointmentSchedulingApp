# Swift_iOSAppointmentSchedulingApp

# SPECIFICATIONS

An application on iOS shares facilities with the operating system. One of these facilities is the calendar and the system database, events, and scheduling services. You have been asked to create an app that is capable of creating, editing, and deleting appointments that are visible in the system calendar. By interacting with the calendar service APIs the appointments, you manage will be system wide. This will require asking the user for permission to use the device calendar so you can perform the CRUD operations necessary (create/read/update/delete).
